    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project utilizes data mining and machine learning techniques to understand and segment a company's customer base. The primary goal is to perform **customer segmentation** using clustering algorithms to uncover distinct, naturally occurring groups of customers. These groups can then be used to personalize marketing strategies, optimize product offerings, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction and business revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "In the absence of a clear understanding of their diverse customer population, businesses often resort to generic marketing, which is inefficient and costly. We aim to transform raw customer data into actionable insights by identifying who the most valuable, and distinct, customer groups are.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Questions\n",
    "1.  **What are the main clusters of customer types within the dataset?** (i.e., identifying the segments)\n",
    "2.  **Which demographic or behavioral variables have the greatest influence on customer spending?** (i.e., interpreting the segments)\n",
    "3.  **How can these insights help businesses target customers more effectively?** (i.e., business application)"

    "#### **1. Total_Spending (Regression Target)**\n",
    "- Created by summing all product spending columns (`Mnt*` features).\n",
    "- The spending distribution is **highly skewed**, with:\n",
    "  - **Mean:** ~$605  \n",
    "  - **Median:** ~$396  \n",
    "  - **Standard Deviation:** ~$601  \n",
    "  - **Maximum:** ~$2,525  \n",
    "- Because spending is heavily right-skewed, applying a **log transformation** may improve regression performance.\n",

    "- The class distribution is:\n",
    "  - **559 high spenders (≈25%)**\n",
    "  - **1,678 non-high spenders (≈75%)**\n",
    "- Although slightly imbalanced, this distribution is still well-suited for models like **Random Forest**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Additional Engineered Features**\n",
    "- **Age** was derived from `2014 − Year_Birth`, and customers older than **99** were filtered out as potential outliers.\n",
    "- **Children** was created by combining `Kidhome + Teenhome` to capture total dependents in the household.\n",
    "- **Income** is now complete with all missing entries filled using the median.\n",
    "- A notable observation is the maximum recorded income of **$666,666**, which may represent an extreme outlier—something that scaling and clustering techniques will address.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Summary\n",
    "- The dataset is now **clean, consistent, and ready for modeling**.\n",
    "- Both target variables—**Total_Spending** for regression and **Is_High_Spender** for classification—are clearly defined and statistically validated.\n",
    "- The engineered demographic and behavioral features enhance the dataset and support more insightful clustering, regression, and classification tasks.\n",
